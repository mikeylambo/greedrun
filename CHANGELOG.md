# Changelog

## Web build — mobile, modifiers & mastery

- Landscape: the phone stage and canvas buffer now follow device orientation,
  filling the screen instead of shrinking to a portrait strip.
- Mobile controls: scale-correct joystick (orientation-agnostic), a touch DROP
  button (the Q-key verb), and pressed feedback on the touch buttons.
- Vault Modifiers: every free run rolls a risk/reward twist — Still Night,
  Gilded Vault, Curfew, Dead Fog, Heavy Purse, or a no-twist Clean Job.
- Modifier Mastery: bank a haul under each twist for a permanent +3%/twist
  sales bonus; progress persists and shows in the hideout.

## v0.1.3 — Godot 4.7 type-inference hotfix

- Replaced the untyped `Node` vault parameter in guard and sentry AI with `GreedrunVault`.
- Explicitly typed the guard visibility test as `bool`, removing the parser failure at `guard.gd:36`.
- Hardened guard movement locals and sentry cone calculations with explicit Godot types.
- Typed guard waypoint arrays and matching Vault spawn helpers to prevent follow-on inference failures.
- Added explicit types to several Vault locals that depend on duplicated typed arrays or nullable scene instances.
- Re-ran `gdlint` across every autoload and gameplay script.

## v0.1.2 — Godot 4.7 native-member hotfix

- Renamed `GreedrunLoot.hidden` to `GreedrunLoot.is_hidden`. Godot 4.7 exposes `hidden` as a native inherited member, so redeclaring it caused a parser error.
- Updated all Vault references to use `item.is_hidden`.
- Preserved the serialized loot configuration key as `"hidden"`, so generation behavior and save compatibility are unchanged.
- Re-ran `gdlint` across all gameplay and autoload scripts with no reported issues.

## v0.1.1 — Parser hotfix

- Fixed the missing indentation in `scripts/vault.gd` inside `can_move()` at the raised-platform collision return.
- Confirmed all autoload and gameplay scripts pass `gdlint` after the correction.
- The reported `main.gd` load failure was a downstream error caused by the invalid Vault script resource.

## v0.1.0 — Initial Godot port

- Ported the evolved HTML prototype and handoff into a standalone Godot 4 project.
- Implemented the complete hideout-to-fence vertical-slice loop.
- Added procedural vault themes, vertical platforms, stealth/chase AI, Heat, contracts, loot personalities, branching artifacts, extraction, buyers, upgrades, Collection restoration and JSON persistence.
- Added keyboard and touchscreen controls.
- Added parser/linter validation, port notes and a structured first-playtest checklist.
